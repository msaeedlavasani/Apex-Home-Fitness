## Reading this manifest (pre-task gate)

- `CURRENT_MAINLINE_BASELINE_COMMIT` is the **verified integration/source
  baseline** described by this manifest — a STABLE reference, never the SHA of
  the commit that contains this file.
- The Git remote is authoritative for the actual current HEAD. At every
  pre-task gate, resolve the actual state dynamically:

```
git fetch <authoritative-remote> main
ACTUAL_REMOTE_MAIN_HEAD=<resolved SHA>
```

Then compare `ACTUAL_REMOTE_MAIN_HEAD` with `CURRENT_MAINLINE_BASELINE_COMMIT`:

- `MATCH` — no commits since the baseline.
- `EXPECTED_DOCS_ONLY_ADVANCE` — main advanced only in `docs/**` since the
  baseline (governance/documentation commits).
- `EXPECTED_INTEGRATION_ADVANCE` — main advanced via a completed task
  integration that was verified and recorded.
- `UNEXPECTED_DRIFT` — anything else. **STOP** and inspect before any task.

## Known operational debt

- **`apexadmin` legacy privileges revoked (2026-08-31):** NOPASSWD:ALL
  (`/etc/sudoers.d/apexadmin`) and Docker-group membership were removed by the
  proof-gated hardening step after the pre-hardening release and rollback
  proof. A fresh SSH session confirmed direct `sudo`, `docker`, and `.env`
  reads all fail while `apex-deploy` still succeeds. `apexadmin` retains only
  its `apexdeploy` group membership (the gateway access group) plus standard
  `sudo`/`users` membership (no passwordless grant).

## Gateway (AUTONOMOUS-PROD-OPS-01) verified state — CLOSED

- Root-owned daemon `apex-deploy-gateway` active on host `sabtbrooker`; socket
  `/run/apex-deploy-gateway/gateway.sock` owned `root:apexdeploy` mode 0660;
  unprivileged client `/usr/local/bin/apex-deploy` uses only that Unix socket
  (no sudo/subprocess; `AF_UNIX` only).
- Post-hardening exact-main release through the unprivileged client:
  `release_id=prodops01-postharden`, `phase=post-hardening`,
  `source_sha=f2387cc3a5b8…` (authoritative GitHub `main` HEAD), image
  `apex-home-fit:release-f2387cc3a5b8` (ID `sha256:7227b1c5…`), DB-unchanged
  (`db_changed=false`), health `PASS`, secret boundary `PROTECTED`. Proof
  written root-only to `/var/lib/apex-deploy-gateway/proof-post-hardening.json`.
- Pre-hardening exact-main release (proof-before-revocation):
  `release_id=prodops01-preharden`, `source_sha=fde82c1a8fb3…` (authoritative
  `main` at that time), image `apex-home-fit:release-fde82c1a8fb3`, health
  `PASS`; proof root-only at
  `/var/lib/apex-deploy-gateway/proof-pre-hardening.json`.
- Rollback evidence: root-only compose snapshots
  `compose.yml.rollback-prodops01-preharden` and
  `compose.yml.rollback-prodops01-postharden` (0600); `verify-rollback`
  through the client returned PASS for both (`previous_image AVAILABLE`);
  marker `/var/lib/apex-deploy-gateway/rollback-verified` present (root-only).
- Fail-closed verified live: arbitrary `command` field rejected, `db_change`
  requests rejected, non-authoritative source SHA rejected.
- Protected boundary: `/opt/apex-home-fit/.env` remains `root:root` 0600 and is
  unreadable by `apexadmin`; gateway returns sanitized JSON only.
- Legacy privileges removed after proof; gateway operation does not depend on
  them (`apexdeploy` group membership retained for `apexadmin`).
- Prerequisite hardening preconditions consumed: `proof-pre-hardening.json`
  and `rollback-verified` both existed before `harden-after-proof.sh` ran.

- Dual compose config on the Production host: both `/opt/apex-home-fit/compose.yml`
  (selected) and `/opt/apex-home-fit/docker-compose.yml` (root-owned) exist;
  `docker compose` warns and uses `compose.yml`. Do not clean up during a
  deployment; needs canonical Governance authorization.
- Admin-route favicon 404: the admin layout (`src/app/admin/layout.tsx`) sets no
  metadata icons, so `/favicon.ico` 404s (console-only) on `/admin/login`. The
  main site sets icons in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`.

## Notes

- **ADMIN-CONSOLE-01 = CLOSED (PRODUCTION_PASS, 2026-08-31).** Admin Console
  V1 (read-oriented Overview, Users, Workout Plans, Exercises, Operations,
  Admin/Sessions) is live on the preserved `apexhomefit_prod_db` volume via
  the canonical Production Deployment Gateway. All six surfaces are server
  components behind `requireAdmin()` with safe projections excluding password
  hashes, session-token hashes, OTP material, and any credential or secret
  values; the admin API boundary remains exactly `login`+`logout`; public
  Phone + OTP behavior unchanged; `DB_CHANGED = NO` (13 migrations, integrity
  `ok`). Exact-main release `2d131fc60453` via `/usr/local/bin/apex-deploy`
  (no privilege elevation); rollback verified; real-browser acceptance 14/14
  PASS (system Chrome) plus unauthenticated boundary verified on Production
  (all six surfaces redirect to `/admin/login`). Main CI PASS on `2d131fc`
  (run `33419999889`) and spec follow-up `e29d311` (run `33425058638`);
  branch retired.

- **AUTONOMOUS-PROD-OPS-01 = CLOSED (PRODUCTION_PASS, 2026-08-31).** The
  constrained root-owned Unix-socket deployment gateway is fully
  operational on `sabtbrooker`: exact-authoritative-`main` releases,
  digest-pinned builds, pinned Prisma, DB-invariant + rollback proof through
  the unprivileged client. Legacy `apexadmin` NOPASSWD sudo and Docker-group
  membership were removed by the proof-gated hardening step; a fresh SSH
  session confirmed sudo/docker/`.env` all fail while `apex-deploy`
  succeeds. Both a pre-hardening and a post-hardening exact-main release
  reached PASS with zero manual Owner commands.

- **ADMIN-AUTH-PROD-01 Production checkpoint = PASS and lifecycle = CLOSED**
  (2026-08-31). Admin Auth V1 is live on the preserved `apexhomefit_prod_db`
  volume (13 migrations, latest `20260831120000_add_admin_auth`). The
  migration was applied deterministically with the lockfile-pinned Prisma
  6.19.3 CLI from an ops image derived from the canonical source — never via
  dynamic `npx prisma` (see
  `docs/PITFALLS/PRISMA-NPX-PRODUCTION-MIGRATION.md`). Two acceptance-time
  defects were fixed via PR #11 (`f6f90d4`): the same-origin check behind the
  reverse proxy (standalone container rebuilds `request.url` from
  HOSTNAME/PORT — see
  `docs/PITFALLS/NEXTJS-STANDALONE-PROXY-SAME-ORIGIN.md`) and the
  provisioning helper's top-level await under CJS. Real-browser Production
  acceptance 22/22 PASS; fix branch `fix/admin-auth-sameorigin-01` retired;
  rollback evidence retained (`compose.yml.rollback-adminauth-3cf9cb6`).
- AUTH-FIX-01 remains the immediate prior checkpoint (source `ce91a4f`, 12
  migrations at that time); its volume-ownership lesson is preserved.
- The historical S02 incident is closed; do not reopen its RSC/digest
  investigation.
- `TASKS.md` is the only executable backlog. Advisory documents cannot
  authorize work.
- No next executable task is currently authorized.
