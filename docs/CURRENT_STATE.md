# Current State — Operational Manifest

Concise canonical snapshot of the repository and Production state. Read this
BEFORE starting any implementation. Rules: `docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md`; runbook:
`docs/FEATURE_TO_PRODUCTION.md`; branches: `docs/BRANCHING_POLICY.md`;
checkpoints: `docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKPOINTS.md`. No secrets are stored here.

## Reading this manifest (pre-task gate)

- `CURRENT_MAINLINE_BASELINE_COMMIT` is the **verified integration/source
  baseline** described by this manifest — a STABLE reference, never the SHA of
  the commit that contains this file.
- The Git remote is authoritative for the actual current HEAD. At every
  pre-task gate, resolve the actual state dynamically:

```
git fetch <authoritative-remote> main
ACTUAL_REMOTE_MAIN_HEAD=<resolved SHA>
```

Then compare `ACTUAL_REMOTE_MAIN_HEAD` with `CURRENT_MAINLINE_BASELINE_COMMIT`:

- `MATCH` — no commits since the baseline.
- `EXPECTED_DOCS_ONLY_ADVANCE` — main advanced only in `docs/**` since the
  baseline (governance/documentation commits).
- `EXPECTED_INTEGRATION_ADVANCE` — main advanced via a completed task
  integration that was verified and recorded.
- `UNEXPECTED_DRIFT` — anything else. **STOP** and inspect before any task.

## Known operational debt

- `apexadmin` currently retains both unrestricted passwordless sudo and Docker
  group membership. `AUTONOMOUS-PROD-OPS-01` must preserve these during
  bootstrap, prove the replacement gateway end-to-end and verify rollback,
  then remove both legacy paths and repeat release acceptance after a fresh
  SSH authentication. Until that proof sequence completes, this is active
  security debt rather than an accepted steady state.

- Dual compose config on the Production host: both `/opt/apex-home-fit/compose.yml`
  (selected) and `/opt/apex-home-fit/docker-compose.yml` (root-owned) exist;
  `docker compose` warns and uses `compose.yml`. Do not clean up during a
  deployment; needs canonical Governance authorization.
- Admin-route favicon 404: the admin layout (`src/app/admin/layout.tsx`) sets no
  metadata icons, so `/favicon.ico` 404s (console-only) on `/admin/login`. The
  main site sets icons in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`.

## Notes

- **ADMIN-AUTH-PROD-01 Production checkpoint = PASS and lifecycle = CLOSED**
  (2026-08-31). Admin Auth V1 is live on the preserved `apexhomefit_prod_db`
  volume (13 migrations, latest `20260831120000_add_admin_auth`). The
  migration was applied deterministically with the lockfile-pinned Prisma
  6.19.3 CLI from an ops image derived from the canonical source — never via
  dynamic `npx prisma` (see
  `docs/PITFALLS/PRISMA-NPX-PRODUCTION-MIGRATION.md`). Two acceptance-time
  defects were fixed via PR #11 (`f6f90d4`): the same-origin check behind the
  reverse proxy (standalone container rebuilds `request.url` from
  HOSTNAME/PORT — see
  `docs/PITFALLS/NEXTJS-STANDALONE-PROXY-SAME-ORIGIN.md`) and the
  provisioning helper's top-level await under CJS. Real-browser Production
  acceptance 22/22 PASS; fix branch `fix/admin-auth-sameorigin-01` retired;
  rollback evidence retained (`compose.yml.rollback-adminauth-3cf9cb6`).
- AUTH-FIX-01 remains the immediate prior checkpoint (source `ce91a4f`, 12
  migrations at that time); its volume-ownership lesson is preserved.
- The historical S02 incident is closed; do not reopen its RSC/digest
  investigation.
- `TASKS.md` is the only executable backlog. Advisory documents cannot
  authorize work.
- No next executable task is currently authorized.
